## The Siren library.
##
## This is the Sire new objects library which provides
## (eventally) the basic class library for Sire, providing
## a consistent Java-style definition of Object types
## (and also Handle and Primitive types)
##

# Import all of the Qt classes
import Sire.Qt

# Import all of the classes and functions from the C++ library
from Sire.Siren._Siren import *

# Now define some pure Python functions and classes that are part of
# this library...
