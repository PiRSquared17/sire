Sire is the name of the library and simulation framework.
There are sub-programs and sub-libraries that have their own,
Sire-derived names;

Squire  : This is the quantum library in Sire

Siren   : This is the New Sire foundation library. This
          is a complete C++ object system that has nothing
          to do with molecular simulation and can provide
          the foundation of any C++ code. Includes the
          sirentest unit testing program

Aquire  : This will be the adaptive, fault-tolerant, distributed
          work queue library (to aquire compute resources).
          This will be the Siren rewrite of SireCluster

Spier   : This is the molecular visualisation library, and also
          the name of the 3D viewer program built on top of Sire

Aspire  : This is the name of the multi-resolution hybrid dynamics
          program that will be built on top of Sire

Inspire : This is the name of the web interface GUI to Sire
          (dynamic collaborative workspace / labbook, together
          with communication and teaching resources)

Soiree  : The collection of post-simulation analysis tools,
          and the library that contains these tools


I still need a new name for SireCAS. Essentially, I need non-Sire names
for libraries that can be relased separately to Sire.
