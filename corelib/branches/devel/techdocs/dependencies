-------------------
Qt
Version >= 4

Why? Main platform on which the code is written.
Provides container classes and helps portability across 
Windows, Linux and Mac

Qt must be compiled with the QSQLITE SQL driver, and with
openGL and threading enabled. Qt has many dependencies, which
should be handled automatically by most platforms. In particular,
Sire needs the Sqlite Qt driver to be compiled and installed.

-------------------
Boost
Version ???

Why? Sire makes heavy use of several Boost libaries, e.g.
boost::python, boost::smart_ptr, boost::tuple, boost::assert,
etc. This is a really excellent collection of libraries that
no self-respecting C++ programmer should be without :-)

-------------------
Python
Version >= 2.4

Why? Required to run the program. Sire contains an embedded
Python parser, and exposes a lot of classes to Python.

-------------------
GNU Scientific Library (GSL)
Version ???

Why? Used by SireMaths to perform matrix diagonalisation. Provides
convienient access to BLAS and LAPACK type functionality. I will eventually
integrate this more with the program and expose to python.

-------------------
BLAS/CBLAS
Version ???

Why? Dependency of GSL.

-------------------
GiNaC
Version >= 1.3

Why? GiNaC is a symbolic algebra system. This will be used by Sire
to allow arbitrary functions to be used for internal energy functions, 
and for the combination of forcefield components into total energies
or forces.

-------------------
CLN
Version ???

Why? Dependency of GiNaC
