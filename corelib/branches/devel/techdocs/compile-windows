First, install Qt4 for windows (mingw compiled version, e.g. qt-win-opensource-4.1.0-mingw.exe)

Install into Qt directory, e.g. C:\Qt\4.1.0

Install the MinGW compiler with the Qt install (when running qt-win...exe, choose to also install
MinGW, and download and install that).

MinGW will be installed to C:\MinGW

Download and install windows version of python (e.g. from python.org, Python 2.4.2 Windows installer link)
Install this somewhere, e.g. C:\Python24\

(this is VC++ compiled, so need to convert libs to correct format for linking by mingw compiler)

Also need to do gsl...

Also need to do boost libraries...

Also need to do MPI libraries...
