Here are some of the *confirmed* differences to ProtoMS that can lead to different energies

(1) ProtoMS uses a single test based on the difference between solvent centers
    to decide on cutoffs and feathering

        - Sire uses a test based on the closest pair of atoms between molecules

(2) ProtoMS uses the mean geometric center of the solvent for the solvent center
    (average of the coordinates)

        - Sire uses the middle of the molecule (middle of max and min coordinates)
