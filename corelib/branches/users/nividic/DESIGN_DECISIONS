======================================
Here are the design decisions in Sire.
These are decisions that restrict the 
kind of simulations that Sire can run.
======================================

(1) Sire is an atomic simulator - contains molecules, which contain atoms.
    (atoms can be arbitrarily beaded, but all molecules contain atoms)

(2) Sire is a 3D program - all coordinates are 3D coordinates, molecules
    do not exist in 4+D space

(3) Atoms in molecules are identified via the atoms name or number, the residue
    name or number of the containing residue, the chain name of the chain
    that contains the residue, and/or the name of the segment of the containing
    segment. This ID information is fixed for a molecule and cannot change.

    (TODO for Siren - allow a molecule to have multiple atom IDs)
