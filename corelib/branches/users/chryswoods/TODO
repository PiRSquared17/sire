SireCAS

(*) Adapt all ExBase classes so that they derive from SireBase::Property,
    remove ExpressionBase, update so everything holds PropPtr<ExBase>

(*) Write code to allow simplification and expansion of sums and products

(*) Take a stab at writing better integration code for sums and products

Spier
-----

(*) Fix Spier so that it works with self-managed molecules.

(*) Rewrite 3D code so that it is more memory efficient (use scaling for cones and
    spheres rather than cached display lists? Can I use non-uniform scaling on 
    a cylinder to make all of the cones that I need for the bonds?)
