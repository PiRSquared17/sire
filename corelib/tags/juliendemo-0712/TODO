=========================================
Sire is being slowly rewritten to use
Siren as a base (this is happening in
the chryswoods branch). The following
TODO items are thus divided between
things to do now, and things which will
be done during the port to Siren
=========================================

TODO NOW
--------


TODO DURING SIREN PORT
----------------------

* Remove CutGroup - replace with Bead (multiple beadings should be possible)

* Add Residues (view of all Residues), Segments, Chains and Beads views

* Port forcefields over to use Bead rather than CutGroup

* Rewrite MoleculeInfoData so that it contains only Atom, Residue, Chain and Segment
  (i.e. ID types). CutGroup should be removed, and Bead placed into Molecule.
  Also, AtomSelection should be rewritten to use Atom+Residue rather than 
  Atom+CutGroup

* Actually, make BeadSchema, ResidueSchema, ChainSchema and SegmentSchema, and
  have MoleculeSchema contain a combination of these

* Rewrite MoleculeData so that it can contain multiple MoleculeInfoData objects.
  Rename MoleculeInfoData to MoleculeSchema. Update the code so that different
  schema can be passed as property names via PropertyMap to all ID functions.

* Rewrite MoleculeData so that atom parameters are arranged by AtomIdx, not CGAtomIdx

* Rewrite all forcefields to munge the data they need, rather than quick copy.
  Energies and forces are much quicker with munged data, and this is worth the small
  cost of munging every time a molecule moves.
