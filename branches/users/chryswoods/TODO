----------
SireStream
----------

(*) Write streaming code for implicitly shared objects (code
    that preserves implicit nature of object - see 
    ideas/qdatastream_implicit

-------
SireCAS
-------

(*) Sort out the code to allow generic-function of a generic-function,
    so that the function substitution works correctly!
    
(*) Write code to allow simplification and expansion of sums and products

(*) Take a stab at writing better integration code for sums and products
    
------
SireDB
------

(*) Improve parameter assignment code by adding a cache for 
    mol/res lookups (so don't lookup mol/res for every single
    atom in the molecule multiple times)
    
(*) Improve parameter assignment code by adding more of a cache
    for atom lookups, so don't lookup an atom more than once
    when assigning internals.
    
(*) Add a score to residue aliases so that they are correctly sorted,
    and can then add default residue backbones that are for residues
    that don't contain any bonding information.
    
(*) Check that can override a residue alias at assignment, e.g.
    user can specify the residue alias in the script, e.g. for 
    residues that are from a scoop that may be incorrectly aliased.

(*) Residue alias code is broken and needs fixing! Also all of the 
    databases need to be documented on a nice web page so that I 
    have more of a clue how they work and how they are inter-related.
    
(*) Dihedral-term code is not working and needs fixing - also need
    to automatically resolve functions and recursively fix function
    of a function

-------
SireMol
-------

(*) Rewrite MoleculeInfo/ResidueInfo so that they are both views of MolInfoData, and
    so that they can support CutGroupNum

(*) Fix all of the broken parts of the code


(*) Integrate ParameterTable into Molecule as a Molecule should contain all of 
    its own parameters... (though must do this taking into account things like
    dummy atoms (e.g. TIP4P) and QM/MM link atoms.

-----
Spier
-----

(*) Fix Spier so that it works with self-managed molecules.

(*) Rewrite 3D code so that it is more memory efficient (use scaling for cones and
    spheres rather than cached display lists? Can I use non-uniform scaling on 
    a cylinder to make all of the cones that I need for the bonds?)

------
SirePy
------

(*) Write generic code that will allow streaming of polymorphic classes that
    are inherited by Python. Streamed class must contain Python code for the
    class, and de-streaming must parse the stored code...
