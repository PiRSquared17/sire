This directory contains the sqlite database driver and complete sqlite source code as
contained in qt-4.3.1

This is included here so that is is definitely compiled with the rest of the application,
with the resulting library placed with the other Sire libraries. This should simplify
the distribution of Sire as it will mean that the user does not have to worry about
ensuring that the qsqlite plugin is available on all platforms (which can include
cluster nodes with limited or no Qt installations) and also that qsqlite can
be used without QCoreApplication, e.g. if Sire is used from plain Python rather
than the sire executable.
