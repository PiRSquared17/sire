Sire uses a strict ID numbering scheme. The ID numbers are used
so the code can make assumptions without having to check if they
are true. This is done for speed...

IDs are of the form IDNumber:MajorVersion.MinorVersion, e.g. 1:2.3

(1) Two objects of the same broad type (e.g. Molecule, ForceField, System)
    are identical if their ID number and Version are the same.

(2) An ID number of 0 implies a null object
    
There are several broad types that use ID numbers. The rules for each
type are as follows;

===== Molecule ======

(1) All molecules with the same ID number have the same MoleculeInfo.

       - implies changing the name of an atom changes the ID number
       - implies changing CutGroup arrangement changes the ID number
       - implies adding or removing atoms changes the ID number
       
(2) All molecules with the same ID number and same Major version number
    have identical molecular properties

       - implies changing any molecular property changes the major 
         version number
       - implies adding or removing properties changes the major
         version number
         
(3) All molecules with the same ID number and same Major and Minor 
    version numbers are identical.
     
       - implies changing the coordinates changes the minor version
         number.

===== ForceField =====

(1) All ForceFields with the same ID number are of the same type.
 
       - Implies that the type of a ForceField cannot change once
         its ID number has been set.
         
(2) All ForceFields with the same ID number and same Major version
    number contain the same molecules (and the molecules are in the 
    same order)
    
       - Implies that adding or removing a molecule changes the 
         major version number
         
       - Does not say that all of the molecules have the same version
         numbers.
         
(3) All ForceFields with the same ID number and major and minor version
    numbers are identical.
    
       - Implies that changing anything about a contained molecule
         must also increase the minor version number of the forcefield.
