Cumalative changes...

Same as InterCLJFF Speed == 5171ms

Copy CLJFF functions into Tip4PFF  Speed = 5333 ms

Explicitly calculate CLJPairMatrix Speed = 5307 ms

Only get CLJ for one molecule Speed = 5027

Use double nrg return for accumalating energies  Speed = 5121 ms

Use only a single scale factor  Speed = 5207 ms

Skip mol with mol (just do cutgroup with cutgroup)  Speed = 4973

Fully skipping mol with mol  Speed = 4915

Using .constData()[i]  Speed = 4876

Inline energy calculation  Speed = 4958

Hard-coded cutoff distance  Speed = 4866

Hard-coded switching function  Speed = 4831
