Connect object to server via;

server->expose(RemoteObject *obj, QString name);

then client can do;

client->connect(localobj,SIGNAL(signame(args),"remotename",SLOT(slotname(args)));
client->connect("remotename",SIGNAL(signame(args)),localobj,SLOT(slotname(args)));

client has a proxy QObject that receieves each client signal, serialises them+args,
sends them to the server. Server proxy then unserialises, works out which function to 
call and then calls it. All asynchronous...

Client+server keep log of all transactions and can kill ones that timeout...

//remoteEmit will probably need to be a macro...
QObject stat = remoteEmit(functionname);

stat emits signals to give the progress of the emit, e.g. pending, sending, error, sent.
